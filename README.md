The dataset is combined by collection images of 2 objects of interest: pears and pear-shaped lamps. <br> 
The annotation was proceed via 2 tools: [Supervisely](https://app.supervise.ly/explore/) and [Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/).

The task was performed on 3 models:
- `yoloV4`
- `yoloV5`
- `faster R-CNN`

The most accurate results are archived with `yoloV5` with precision and accuracy metrics higher than 95%. 

I have enjoyed practicing new tools and embracing knowledge of object detection task. <br> 
It was cool experience!
